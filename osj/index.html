            <h3>2019-05-03 Lozza&apos;z Blozzas</h3>
            <p>had a fresh cut yesterday. There was a lot of hair on the floor which is always a good sign. My hair is
                nice and bouncy but not triangular. Didn't actually have a blow dry but willing to overlook it. Did have
                to use my own hair products to
                style. 8.5/10</p>

            <h3>2019-05-03 Kate&apos;s Plates</h3>
            <p>I went to the pizza stall in white cross street, and ordered a palma ham and something, which was really
                nice.
            </p>
            <p>The whole scenario is really fun because the pizza is authentic italian so the making of it adopts the
                whole italian passionate dramatics that you see when in italy itself. This includes the couple making
                the pizzas shouting at each other,
                and wielding a knife during a particularly heated moment.</p>
            <p>I would recommend this place for lunch.</p>

            <h3>2019-05-03 Freddy Steady Cook!</h3>
            <p>Freddy had sausage sandwich for breakfast from Lennies in Old Street Station. On a scale of 1-9 it was a
                7. Point to note that the establishment is called Lennys but their card payments will appear as
                Riccardos on your bank statement. Is this
                an example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering ">‘layering’</a>? Who knows!</p>

            <h3>2019-04-29 Aiden’s Flatmates move out</h3>
            <p>
                A pair of my flatmates are moving out. They had lots of stuff and took a lot of space, so now the house
                is really empty. We used to use their projector, hifi, and pots - I suppose we will have to replace them
                or stop eating and watching tv. A guy from
                New Zealand is moving in soon to replace them. That’ll be interteresting I hope.
