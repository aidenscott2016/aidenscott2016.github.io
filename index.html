	    <h3>2019-04-29 Aiden’s Flatmates move out</h3>
	    <p>
	    A pair of my flatmates are moving out. They had lots of stuff and took a lot of space, so now the house is really empty.
	    We used to use their projector, hifi, and pots - I suppose we will have to replace them or stop eating and watching tv.
	    A guy from New Zealand is moving in soon to replace them. That’ll be interteresting I hope.
