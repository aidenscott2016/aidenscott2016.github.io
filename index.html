  <h2>Aiden's Flatmates move out</h2>
  <p>
  A pair of my flatmates are moving out. They had lots of stuff and took a lot of space, so now the house is really empty.
  We used to use their projector, hifi, and pots - I suppose we will have to replace them or stop eating and watching tv.
  A guy from New Zealand is moving in soon to replace them. That'll be interteresting I hope.
